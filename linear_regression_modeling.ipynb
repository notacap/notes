Summary

Linear Regression models try to predict an output variable with one or more input predictor variables.

For example - we can use passing yards as an input variable, with touchdowns as the output variable. the model will try to predict if passing yards can accurately predict touchdowns.

Meta Notes

Model assumptions: Linear regression assumes that the data meet certain conditions, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality, and no multicollinearity. It's essential to check these assumptions before interpreting the results.

Overfitting and regularization: Regularization techniques, such as Lasso or Ridge regression, can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.


MSE (Mean Squared Error)

Definition: Measures how accurately the model is predicting the output

What you need to know

A lower MSE means the model is accurately predicting the output based on the input. In other words, the model is working! (given other relevant results are indicating the model is understanding the underlying dynamics and relationships of the data from a input variable level and dataset level)

Details

It does this by using the input variable to predict the output variable, then compares the result of that prediction with the actual result, then measures the difference as MSE (Mean squared error, or average squared distance). A lower MSE means the model is able to more accurately predict the output based on the input.

The ranges are as follows

Low MSE (e.g., < 10): The model is doing a good job predicting the outcome variable.
Moderate MSE (e.g., 10-50): The model is somewhat accurate, but there's room for improvement.
High MSE (e.g., > 50): The model is not doing a great job predicting the outcome variable
If the result is a high MSE, aside from checking the data to make sure it is clean, or pulling from a different data source, either add or remove input variables.

Meta Notes

MSE ranges: While the ranges you provided are a good starting point, it's essential to note that MSE ranges can vary depending on the specific problem and data. What might be considered a low MSE in one context might be high in another.



Coefficients

Definition: Measures the difference in change of the predicted output when small changes to the input are introduced, independently of other variables

What you need to know

A lower coefficient means a stronger relationship between the input variable and the output variable. Variables with higher coefficients (weaker relationships) can be replaced/removed.

When interpreting coefficients, it's essential to consider both the magnitude and the p-value. A large coefficient with a low p-value indicates a strong, statistically significant relationship.

Details

Coefficients are a measurement of the change in the predicated outcome variable whenever the input variable changes by 1, while holding all other predictor variables constant.

We can tell the strength of the relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome variable with a smaller coefficient. By comparing coefficients, you can understand which variable is having a greater impact on the outcome variable

The model uses the coefficient value to calculate the predicted outcome value.

Coefficients values are used to make predictions for new, unseen data.

When making predictions, the model uses the coefficient values to calculate the weighted sum of the input values. The weighted sum is then used to calculate the predicted outcome variable value.
For example, let's say you want to predict the total_PF value for a team with 3000 passing yards, 1000 rushing yards, and 200 rushing attempts. The model would use the coefficient values to calculate the weighted sum:
total_PF = (passing_Yds x 0.0965) + (rushing_Yds x 0.0944) + (rushing_Att x 0.1589) + intercept
The model would then use this weighted sum to calculate the predicted total_PF value.
Less change is good because it indicates the model is more stable and less sensitive to small changes in input data. This basically means the model is more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data
Overfitting: when a model learns the noise of in the training data and not the underlying patterns. As a result, the model will perform well on training data but not on new data. The whole point is to train the model to the point where it can accurately make predictions with new data.
Generalization: Refers to a model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data. A model that generalizes well can make accurate predictions on data is has never seen before because it has learned the underlying patterns and relationships
Coefficients that are too large or too sensitive to small changes in the input data can indicate overfitting. This is because large coefficients can cause the model to be overly sensitive to small changes in the input data, leading to poor performance on new data.

Basically, if the model understands the underlying patterns and relationships (generalization), it won't overreact to small changes in the input, whereas if the model doesn't understand (overfitting), the model won't really know how to react to smaller changes, and therefor would overreact?

Meta Notes
Coefficient interpretation: You mentioned that a lower coefficient means a stronger relationship between the input variable and the output variable. However, it's more accurate to say that a larger coefficient (in absolute value) indicates a stronger relationship.

Coefficient significance: When interpreting coefficients, it's essential to consider both the magnitude and the p-value. A large coefficient with a low p-value indicates a strong, statistically significant relationship.




R-Squared

Definition: Measures how well the model is understanding the underlying dynamics and relationships of the data set

What you need to know

A higher R-Squared value means the model is understanding the underlying dynamics of the data. The better it can understand the underlying dynamics, the better it can handle new, generalized data. A lower R-Squared value means the model isn't understanding the underlying data, and will perform poorly when trying to make predictions with never before seen data.

Details

You can check if a model is a good fit with the R-Squared value. A high R-Squared value indicates that the model is able to capture a large proportion of the variation in the data, which means it has a good understanding of the underlying dynamics.

A higher R-squared value means the model is capturing a higher amount of the variation in the output values. In other words, the model is able to account for a large part of why the output variable values are different from each other.

A higher R-squared value  does NOT mean the model is accurately predicting the output, but rather that it's able to understand the underlying patterns and relationships that drive the variation in the output values

The range for R2 is 0 (worst) - 1 (best)

Meta Notes

R-Squared interpretation: You correctly stated that a higher R-Squared value means the model is understanding the underlying dynamics of the data. However, it's also important to note that R-Squared only measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, not the accuracy of the predictions.


P Value

Definition: Measures if the coefficient (strength of relationship between input and output variables) is real or by chance

What you need to know

A lower P value means the chance that the coefficient value (strength of the relationship between the input variable and the output variable) is 'statistically significant', or how likely the relationship between the input and output variables is real and not by chance. A higher P value signifies the relationship is likely due to chance or coincidence

Details

P-values represent the probability of observing the coefficient value (or a more extreme value) by chance, assuming that the true coefficient value is zero. In other words, p-values measure the probability of obtaining the observed coefficient value (or a more extreme value) if there is no real relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome variable.

Meta Notes

P-value interpretation: Your explanation of p-values is mostly correct. However, it's essential to note that p-values don't directly measure the probability of the relationship being real or by chance. Instead, they measure the probability of observing the coefficient value (or a more extreme value) assuming that the true coefficient value is zero.

Additional Notes
Model Assumptions
Linear regression assumes that the data meet certain conditions, which are crucial for the model to be reliable and accurate. These assumptions are:

	1. Linearity: The relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome variable should be linear. In other words, the relationship should be straight-line, not curved or non-linear.
	2. Independence: Each observation (data point) should be independent of the others. This means that the data shouldn't be correlated or influenced by each other.
	3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals (errors) should be constant across all levels of the predictor variables. This means that the spread of the errors shouldn't change as the predictor variables change.
	4. Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed, meaning they should follow a bell-shaped curve.
No multicollinearity: The predictor variables shouldn't be highly correlated with each other. This means that the variables shouldn't be redundant or duplicate.
